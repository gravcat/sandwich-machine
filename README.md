## How To Run

### Traditional Install 🐍

ℹ️ Requires [Python 3.10.4+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

1. Double click run.bat (or run.sh if you're on mac or linux)

### Docker (_multi-platform sandwiching!_) 🐳

ℹ️ Requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

The following command will download the small docker image, and execute interactively for expedient, effective sandwich generation.

`docker run -it ghcr.io/sandwich-machine/sandwich-machine:main`

Subsequent runs will use the existing local image. To update, simply:

`docker pull ghcr.io/sandwich-machine/sandwich-machine:main`
